insane linework test isn't showing up on the map
show feature stats (length, area, elevation, etc)
instead of hiding small polygons and lines, render them as a point at low zooms the color of their border/line

Later:
See how https://trails.colorado.gov loads their data in the map
Debug log messages are hidden by default and only shown if a user enables that in his settings
validate that `FILE_TYPE_CONFIGS[file_type].max_size` is always less than 200 or else the database will break
