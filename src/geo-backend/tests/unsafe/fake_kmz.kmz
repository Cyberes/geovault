This is not a KMZ file at all!
It's just plain text with a .kmz extension.
This should be rejected by file signature validation.

KMZ files should be ZIP archives starting with PK\x03\x04
This file starts with "This is not a KMZ file"

This file is designed to test:
1. File signature validation (should fail - not a ZIP file)
2. MIME type validation
3. Content structure validation

The file should be rejected because:
- It doesn't start with ZIP file signature
- It's not a valid ZIP archive
- It has the wrong MIME type
- It's not a valid KMZ structure
