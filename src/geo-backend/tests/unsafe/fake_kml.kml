This is not a KML file at all!
It's just plain text with a .kml extension.
This should be rejected by file signature validation.

Some malicious content:
<script>alert('XSS!')</script>
<iframe src="javascript:alert('XSS!')"></iframe>

This file is designed to test:
1. File signature validation
2. MIME type validation
3. Content structure validation

The file should be rejected because:
- It doesn't start with <?xml
- It's not valid XML
- It contains malicious content
- It has the wrong MIME type
