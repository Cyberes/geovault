insane linework test isn't showing up on the map

Later:
For tracks, set the created date to the timestamp of the first point in the track
See how https://trails.colorado.gov loads their data in the map
Debug log messages are hidden by default and only shown if a user enables that in his settings
validate that `FILE_TYPE_CONFIGS[file_type].max_size` is always less than 200 or else the database will break
