# GeoVault

*Platform to organize your personal spatial data in a unified database.*

An outdoorsman tends to collect all sorts of spatial data: tracks of hikes, points of interest, and so on. This data
tends to be scattered across numerous files and it isn't easy to see where you've been. *GeoVault* is a web platform
that stores your data and presents *all* of it on one map.

**Features:**

- Streamlined upload and import process that makes it easy to shove your spatial data into the database
- KMZ, KML, and GPX files supported
- Tag and collection based organization
- Link-based public sharing
- Reverse geocoding to show what features are associated with

**This platform does not support editing.** Use your own preferred tool and then upload your data to the server.
