# geoserver

*Service to organize unified spatial data.*



This project is similar to [GeoNetwork](https://www.geonetwork-opensource.org): a spatial information management environment. But where GeoNetwork is designed for cataloging geospatial data into discrete datasets for professional and academic projects, *geoserver* is used by an individual to store, organize, and share their personal spatial information on an easy to use and self-hosted platform.



**This platform does not support editing.** Use your own preferred tool and then upload your data to the server.
